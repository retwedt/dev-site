<h2><strong>General  Tour Information</strong></h2>
<h3>Customer  notifications</h3>

<p class="yellow">When you book a tour with Explore California, you should  receive two notifications via email. The first will be a tour confirmation, which states that your tour is booked, gives you  the dates of your tour, and lists all amenities included in your package. The  second notification should arrive two weeks prior to the start of your tour.  This will be a reminder notification  and will contain your tour dates and current tour conditions, if applicable. <span>If you do not receive a confirmation within  24 hours, or the reminder notification two weeks out, contact us immediately.</span>  We&rsquo;ll make sure there are no problems in the system and confirm your tour.</p>
<h3>Tour  vouchers</h3>
<p>Some tour packages include tour vouchers. <div id="formatText">These tour  vouchers allow you to participate in optional activities during a tour and are  usually scheduled for downtime or as an optional choice to replace the day&rsquo;s  featured activity. The vouchers are only good during the tour and have no cash  value, and cannot be redeemed if the tour is not taken.</div> <!--end div "formatText"-->The tour vouchers are  negotiated with 3rd party vendors. Although Explore California  monitors these vendors closely, we cannot guarantee that scheduled activities  will take place.</p>
<h3>Trip  planning</h3>
<p>After registration, you will be sent a PDF trip planning  document specific to your tour. <strong>In the Trip Planner we offer packing advice,  places of interest along the tour route, a historical and environmental  overview of the tour, a list of any required equipment for the tour that is not provided by Explore California, and  additional resources for researching the surrounding area and points of  interest included in your tour.</strong> Additional information about specific tours can  be found in our FAQ section.</p>
<h3>Tour  checklist</h3>
<p class="yellow">As you prepare for your tour, we want to make sure that you  have everything you need to fully enjoy your time in California. Having  everything in place when you arrive makes it easy to sit back and enjoy all  that your tour has to offer. With that in mind, we&rsquo;ve prepared a small  checklist to help you make sure you&rsquo;re ready to go!</p>
