<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I was born in 1988, the first of four children, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska.  In 2010, I graduated from Iowa State University with a B.S. in Biochemistry.  I returned to Omaha, and worked in a quality assurance lab at Cargill, examining the composition of corn-based biopolymers.  After a year, I returned to school to take prerequisite classes in preparation for graduate school.</p>
<p>I am currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago, working towards a masters in Biomedical Visualization.  This exciting field combines my interests in medicine, art and technology.  I hope to expand my knowledge of user-interactive computer technologies, and learn about emerging technology such as augmented reality.</p>
