# Rex Twedt's Website

This website was built to function as a single page web app, using AJAX to provide a smooth transition between content and a seamless user experience.  Several additional tools for convenient modern web development were used:

-	[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - automation with JavaScript and Node.js
-	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a framework for server-side JavaScript development
-	[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) - a flexible css extension 
-	[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - a popular JS library built around simplifying code and maximizing compatibility
-	[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - responsive HTML/CSS/JS framework
-	[Bootstrap Dropdown Hover plugin](https://github.com/CWSpear/bootstrap-hover-dropdown) - plug-in to allow Bootstrap dropdown menus to activate on hover 
-	[Fancybox](http://fancybox.net/) - library for displaying images, html content and multi-media using a lightbox overlay
