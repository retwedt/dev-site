# Rex Twedt's Portfolio Website

This website was built to function as a single page web app, using AJAX to provide a smooth transition between content and a seamless user experience.  Several additional tools for convenient modern web development were used:

-	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time
-	[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - an open-source JavaScript module bundler!
-	[Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) - a flexible stylesheet preprpocessor language
